# Automatic-Plant-Watering-System
A hardware project using required peripherals and arduino UNO 
<hr>
Basically this is a soil moisture monitoring system, which 	detects whether the moisture content in the soil is above or below a certain satisfactory threshold value. 
If it goes below a certain satisfactory threshold value then it will check the humidity and water level. If all of them are fair, then the water pump will pump the water to the plant. Relay Module controls the mini water pump. Otherwise the buzzer will rises up to fill the water container.
